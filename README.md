# Telegram Marketplace Frontend

This repository contains a Vite + React implementation of the Telegram Marketplace Web App interface exported from the provided Figma design. The UI, animations, and interaction patterns are reproduced one-to-one based on the design prototype and powered by a comprehensive application context that simulates the marketplace logic for admins, designers, and customers.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:5173` by default. To build a production bundle use `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`.

> **Note:** Installing dependencies requires access to the public npm registry. If the default registry is blocked in your environment you may need to configure a proxy or mirror before running `npm install`.
